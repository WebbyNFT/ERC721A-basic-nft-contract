# Basic NFT ERC721A Contract

Ready contract for deploying NFT collection.

It uses **ERC721A** standard which is much cheaper
and minting costs 1/10 of normal ERC721 standard.

It can be deployed by [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). It can be also easily verified by using Remix "ETHERSCAN - CONTRACT VERIFICATION" plugin - link for tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9PD2zttmk).

You have to change collection name (26 line of code), collection symbol (26 line of code) and metadata url (12 line of code).

Initial values for contract are:

- uriPrefix: ""
- uriSuffix: ".json"
- nftPerAddressLimit: 1
- price: 0.02 ether
- maxSupply: 222
- paused: true
