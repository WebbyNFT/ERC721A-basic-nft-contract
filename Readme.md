# Basic NFT Solidity Contract

Ready contract for deploying NFT collection.

It uses **ERC721A** standard which is much cheaper
and minting costs 1/10 of normal ERC721 standard.

It can be deployed by [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). It can be also easily verified by using Remix "ETHERSCAN - CONTRACT VERIFICATION" plugin,
link for tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9PD2zttmk).

You have to change collection name (26 line of code), collection symbol (26 line of code) and metadata url (12 line of code).

Initial values for contract are:

- Uri prefix (metadata url): linkToMetadata
- Nft per address limit: 1
- Price: 0.02 ether
- Supply: 222
